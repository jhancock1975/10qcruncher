10qcruncher is software that downloads current 10-q quarterly reports
from the United State's Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR
database, and generates buy/sell/hold recommendations based on those
reports.

For now, this is an Eclipse/STS project. Delete all .project files
in other branches for your convenience.

Project structure:
10qcruncher is a maven project.

10qcruncher is composed of core and API components, 10qcruncher-core,
and 10qcruncher-api, respectively.

One may build the components separately; however we give only the
directions for building the project in its entirety.

The 10qcruncher-core module has a dependency on the 10q-cruncher-api
module. 10q-cruncher api contains auto-generated code.

In order to do development in 10qcruncher-core, one must run
mvn install
in the 10qcruncher-api directory to locally install the API library
in his or her local repository.

Building:

From this directory, type:
mvn compile
